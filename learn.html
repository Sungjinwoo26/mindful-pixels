                <h2>The Foundations of Mindfulness</h2>
                <p>At Mindful Pixels, we believe that understanding the 'why' behind a practice is just as important as the 'how'. Here, we explore the core principles of yoga and meditation.</p>

                <h3>What is Yoga?</h3>
                <p>Yoga is more than just physical postures; it's an ancient practice that unites the body, mind, and spirit. Through a combination of breathing techniques (pranayama), postures (asanas), and meditation, yoga cultivates awareness, reduces stress, and enhances physical health. It teaches us to find stillness in movement and to carry that calm into our daily lives.</p>

                <h3>What is Meditation?</h3>
                <p>Meditation is the practice of training your attention to achieve a state of mental clarity and emotional calm. It’s not about stopping your thoughts, but about observing them without judgment. By focusing on a single point—like your breath, a sound, or a sensation—you can quiet the mental noise and connect with a deeper sense of peace.</p>

                <div class="learn-cta">
                    <h3>Ready to Begin Your Practice?</h3>
                    <p>Our custom meditation timer is the perfect tool to help you get started. Set your duration, press play, and allow the gentle chimes and breathing circle to guide you.</p>

                <h3>Simple Meditation Techniques</h3>
                <ol class="techniques-list">
                    <li><strong>Mindful Breathing:</strong> Find a comfortable seat. Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering your nostrils and filling your lungs. When your mind wanders, gently guide it back to your breath. Start with just 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body Scan:</strong> Lie down comfortably. Bring your awareness to your toes, noticing any sensations without judgment. Slowly move your attention up through your feet, legs, torso, arms, and head. This practice enhances body awareness and releases tension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loving-Kindness Meditation:</strong> In a quiet space, repeat phrases of well-wishing for yourself, such as "May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be at peace." Then, extend these wishes to loved ones, neutral people, and eventually, all beings.</li>
                </ol>
